Facebook Homebrew Tap
=====================

This is a [Homebrew][brew] tap for formulae for software developed by Facebook.


Setup
-----

Using these formulae requires Homebrew, which in turn requires Xcode. If you
have not yet installed Homebrew, a quick summary is at the end of this
document.

Once homebrew is installed, simply run:

    brew tap alonlevih/fb

Some of these formulae may require OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) or higher.
